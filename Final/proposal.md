1. My final project will be to render a room with multiple objects and a light source inside. 
   The light source will accurately cast shadows from the other objects in the room, and the user will be able to move the 
   objects around the scene while the shadows move appropriately with the movement of the objects.

2. Implementation Steps
  Week 1: 
    Collect 3D models and textures for the objects in the room (couch, table, lamp, general objects that would go in a living room).
  Week 2: 
    Import the models into the scene and render them and the room.
  Week 3:
    Implement the light source.
  Week 4: 
    Implement the sliders the user will use to move the objects.
  Week 5: (Stretch goals)
    Let the user be able to rotate the room.
    Add another light source.

3. I will create a web-based application using THREE.js.
